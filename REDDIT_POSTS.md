### Title:
```
I built a free tool to find crypto arbitrage opportunities across exchanges
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/CryptoCurrency!

I've been trading crypto for a while and noticed something interesting: prices often differ between exchanges, sometimes by 1-2% or more. This creates arbitrage opportunities, but tracking them manually is nearly impossible.

So I built a free tool that:
- Compares prices across Binance, MEXC, and Bybit in real-time
- Shows spreads with fees already calculated
- Updates every 15 minutes
- Includes Polymarket sentiment data (bonus feature)

Here's what it looks like: [screenshot would go here]

**Example from today:**
- BTC: $600 spread between exchanges
- After fees: ~$420 profit potential
- ETH: $45 spread, ~$30 profit potential

The tool is completely free, no signup required. I built it for myself but figured others might find it useful.

**What I'd love from you:**
- Feedback on what features would be most useful
- Are there other exchanges you'd want to see?
- Any bugs or issues you notice?

I'm also open to suggestions for improvements. What would make this tool more valuable for you?

### Comments (להכין מראש):
```
Thanks for the feedback! I'm working on adding [feature they mentioned].

The tool updates every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions. I'm considering making it real-time, but that would require more infrastructure.

For those asking about fees - yes, I calculate them in. The "profit potential" is after estimated fees.

## 🎯 גרסה 2: Story-Based (יותר אישי)

### Title:
```
I made $500 last month with crypto arbitrage - here's the tool I built to find opportunities
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/CryptoCurrency!

I've been doing crypto arbitrage for about 6 months now. Started small, learned a lot, and last month made about $500 in profit.

The hardest part? Finding opportunities. Prices change fast, and manually checking 3-4 exchanges is impossible.

So I built a tool that does it automatically:
- Real-time price comparison across major exchanges
- Spread calculator (includes fees)
- Shows which exchange to buy/sell on
- Updates every 15 minutes

**How it works:**
1. Tool monitors prices across Binance, MEXC, Bybit
2. Calculates spreads (price difference)
3. Subtracts fees to show net profit
4. Displays top opportunities

**My results:**
- Found 3-5 profitable spreads per day
- Average profit: $50-150 per trade
- Best day: $200 profit on BTC spread

**Important notes:**
- Transfer times matter (spreads disappear fast)
- Always verify fees on your end
- Start small to test
- Not financial advice - do your own research

I'm sharing this because I wish I had it when I started. It's completely free, no signup.

## 🎯 גרסה 3: Educational (פחות פרסומי)

### Title:
```
How I track crypto arbitrage opportunities across exchanges (free tool I built)
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/CryptoCurrency!

I see a lot of questions about crypto arbitrage here, so I wanted to share how I track opportunities.

**The Problem:**
Crypto prices differ between exchanges. Sometimes by 0.5%, sometimes by 2%+. This creates arbitrage opportunities, but:
- Prices change fast
- Hard to track manually
- Fees eat into profits
- Transfer times matter

**My Solution:**
I built a tool that monitors prices across exchanges and calculates profitable spreads.

**How it works:**
1. Fetches prices from Binance, MEXC, Bybit APIs
2. Calculates spreads (price difference)
3. Subtracts estimated fees
4. Shows net profit potential
5. Updates every 15 minutes

**Example:**
- BTC price on Binance: $40,000
- BTC price on MEXC: $40,600
- Gross spread: $600 (1.5%)
- After fees: ~$420 profit potential

**Important considerations:**
- Transfer time: spreads can disappear
- Fees vary by exchange
- KYC requirements
- Withdrawal limits

The tool is free and open. I built it for myself but figured others might find it useful.

## 🎯 גרסה 4: Question-Based (מעורר דיון)

### Title:
```
How do you find crypto arbitrage opportunities? I built a tool but want to know your methods
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/CryptoCurrency!

I've been interested in crypto arbitrage for a while. The concept is simple: buy low on one exchange, sell high on another. But finding opportunities is the hard part.

**What I've tried:**
1. Manual checking (too slow)
2. Price alert bots (too many false positives)
3. Building my own tool (current solution)

**My current approach:**
I built a tool that:
- Monitors prices across Binance, MEXC, Bybit
- Calculates spreads with fees
- Updates every 15 minutes
- Shows top opportunities

It's helped me find 3-5 profitable spreads per day.

**But I want to learn from you:**
- How do you find arbitrage opportunities?
- What tools/methods do you use?
- What exchanges do you monitor?
- Any tips for beginners?

I'm sharing my tool in case it's useful: [coinnavigator.net]

But more importantly, I'd love to hear your strategies and learn from the community!

What's your arbitrage workflow?

## 💬 תגובות מוכנות מראש

### אם שואלים על אמינות:
```
I understand the skepticism. The tool uses public APIs from the exchanges (Binance, MEXC, Bybit). You can verify the prices yourself. I'm not making any claims about guaranteed profits - just showing price differences.
```

### אם שואלים על רווחיות:
```
Good question! Arbitrage isn't always profitable. You need to factor in:
- Transfer times (spreads disappear fast)
- Fees (varies by exchange)
- Withdrawal limits
- KYC requirements

The tool shows potential, but you need to do your own research and calculations.
```

### אם שואלים על עדכונים:
```
Currently updates every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions. I'm considering real-time updates, but that would require more infrastructure. For now, 15 minutes is a good balance between freshness and cost.
```

### אם שואלים על בורסות נוספות:
```
Great suggestion! I'm focusing on Binance, MEXC, and Bybit because I have affiliate links with them (disclosed on the site). I'm open to adding more exchanges if there's demand. Which ones would be most useful?
```

### אם שואלים על אפיליאייט:
```
Yes, I have affiliate links with the exchanges. It's disclosed on the site. The tool is free regardless - the affiliate links are just how I monetize. I don't recommend exchanges I wouldn't use myself.
```

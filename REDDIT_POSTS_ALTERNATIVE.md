I built a free tool to find crypto arbitrage opportunities across exchanges
```

### Body:

Hey r/cryptomarkets!

I've been trading crypto for a while and noticed something interesting: prices often differ between exchanges, sometimes by 1-2% or more. This creates arbitrage opportunities, but tracking them manually is nearly impossible.

So I built a free tool that:
- Compares prices across Binance, MEXC, and Bybit in real-time
- Shows spreads with fees already calculated
- Updates every 15 minutes
- Includes Polymarket sentiment data (bonus feature for market intelligence)

**How it works:**
The tool monitors prices across 3 major exchanges and calculates:
- Gross spread (price difference)
- Net profit (after estimated fees)
- Best buy/sell exchanges
- Updates automatically every 15 minutes

**Example from today:**
- BTC: Found a $600 spread between exchanges
- After fees: ~$420 profit potential
- ETH: $45 spread, ~$30 profit potential

**Important notes:**
- This is informational only, not financial advice
- Always verify fees and transfer times yourself
- Spreads can disappear fast - speed matters
- Start small to test if you're new to arbitrage

The tool is completely free, no signup required. I built it for myself but figured others might find it useful.

**What I'd love from you:**
- Feedback on what features would be most useful
- Are there other exchanges you'd want to see?
- Any bugs or issues you notice?
- Suggestions for improvements

I'm also happy to answer questions about how arbitrage works or how the tool calculates spreads.

```
Free tool to find Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities across exchanges
```

### Body:

Hey r/BitcoinMarkets!

I've been doing Bitcoin arbitrage for a while and built a tool to track price differences across exchanges.

**The problem:**
Bitcoin prices differ between exchanges. Sometimes by 0.5%, sometimes by 2%+. This creates arbitrage opportunities, but tracking them manually is impossible.

**My solution:**
A free tool that:
- Monitors BTC prices across Binance, MEXC, and Bybit
- Calculates spreads with fees included
- Shows net profit potential
- Updates every 15 minutes

**Example:**
- BTC on Binance: $40,000
- BTC on MEXC: $40,600
- Gross spread: $600 (1.5%)
- After fees: ~$420 profit potential

**Important:**
- Transfer times matter (spreads disappear fast)
- Always verify fees on your end
- Start small to test
- Not financial advice

The tool is free, no signup. I built it for myself but sharing in case it's useful.
